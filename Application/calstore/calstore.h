  * @file    calstore.h
  * @brief   Write-once calibration store for the 8AIC module.
  *
  * Per-channel 2-point linear calibration (I_true = gain·I_raw + offset) is
  * kept in a dedicated internal-Flash sector (Sector 11) that the firmware
  * NEVER erases during normal operation — not on settings save, not on factory
  * reset. Each of the 8 channel slots can be committed
  * exactly once: once a slot is programmed it cannot be rewritten, because
  * internal Flash can only clear bits (1 → 0) without a full sector erase.
  *
  * The live (working) coefficients live in RAM here. Modbus writes update the
  * live values as a preview (rejected if the slot is already locked); a
  * separate commit persists the live values into the slot and locks it.
  *
  * The only way to un-lock is calstore_erase(), which erases the whole sector
  * and reverts every slot to the neutral defaults (gain = 1.0, offset = 0.0).
  * That path is intended for a protected, physically-confirmed service action.
